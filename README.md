# Project 4:  Brevet time calculator

Designed to give users feedback in the page instead of clicking a
submit button every time they want to calculate the brevet control
distance times, this web application gives users an easy way to
calculate when they need to open and close their control points
in their brevet.

## Implementation

Based on the calculator from https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html, the
calculator is upgraded because it uses AJAX to give users instant
calculations and feedback for the inputs. The backend is run on Flask.
